# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This comprehensive guide covers the development of intelligent humanoid robots using ROS 2 and AI agents.

## Overview

This book is organized into several modules that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of humanoid robotics:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2, communication patterns, URDF modeling, and AI agent integration.
- **Module 2**: Perception Systems - Vision, sensing, and environment understanding.
- **Module 3**: Motion Planning and Control - Advanced control algorithms and movement planning.
- **Module 4**: AI and Learning Systems - Machine learning, reinforcement learning, and adaptive behaviors.

## Getting Started

Each module contains theoretical concepts, practical examples, and hands-on exercises designed to build your expertise in humanoid robotics development.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Mathematics background (linear algebra, calculus)
