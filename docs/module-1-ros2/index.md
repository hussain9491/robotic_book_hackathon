# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module covers the fundamentals of ROS 2 as the "nervous system" of humanoid robots, focusing on middleware for robot control.

6. [Capstone Lab: Building the Humanoid Control Pipeline](./chapters/chapter-6-capstone.md)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Set up and configure a ROS 2 workspace for humanoid robot development
- Create nodes, publishers, subscribers, and services using rclpy
- Model humanoid robots using URDF
- Integrate AI agents with ROS 2 controllers
- Use launch files and parameters for system management
