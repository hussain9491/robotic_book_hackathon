# Chapter 6: Capstone Lab: Building the Humanoid Control Pipeline

## Integrating All Components

This capstone lab combines all the concepts learned in previous chapters into a complete humanoid robot control pipeline.

## Student Implementation Requirements

Students will implement:
- URDF model of a humanoid robot
- Control nodes for different body parts
- Parameter configuration system
- Launch file to start the complete system
- AI agent bridge for high-level commands

## Testing in RViz Without Simulation Physics

The complete system will be tested in RViz for visualization without requiring full physics simulation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:
- Integrate all components of a humanoid robot control system
- Create a complete working pipeline
- Test and validate the integrated system
- Troubleshoot common integration issues

## Lab Exercise: Complete Humanoid Control System

Implement and test a complete humanoid robot control system that integrates all components from previous chapters.
